# Vision: Intelligence Layer Over NYC

## What We're Actually Building

This isn't just an API wrapper. This is an **intelligence layer** that can answer questions about New York City that don't exist in any single dataset.

## The Power of Cross-Dataset Queries

### Questions No Single Dataset Can Answer

**Housing + Finance:**
> "Show me neighborhoods with high housing violations and low city spending on housing programs"

**Events + Transportation + Complaints:**
> "Do major street events correlate with parking complaints and traffic violations?"

**Infrastructure + Finance + Quality:**
> "Is there a relationship between DOT spending on street repairs and reduction in pothole complaints?"

**Housing + Code Enforcement + Finance:**
> "Which landlords have both HPD violations and unpaid city fines?"

## Real Use Cases

### 1. Investigative Journalism
Data journalists spend weeks building custom scripts to correlate datasets. This does it in seconds.

**Example Story:**
- Query: "Buildings with housing violations AND low property tax payments AND city contracts"
- Potential headline: "Slum landlords getting city contracts while tenants suffer"

### 2. Policy Analysis
City planners and advocacy groups can test hypotheses in real-time.

**Example Analysis:**
- "Does increased HPD enforcement correlate with reduced housing complaints?"
- "Are Vision Zero investments reducing traffic incidents in target areas?"

### 3. Neighborhood Intelligence
Real estate, community boards, and residents can understand their area holistically.

**Example Query:**
- "Complete neighborhood report: events, housing quality, street conditions, city investment, public safety spending"

### 4. Accountability Tracking
Follow the money and measure outcomes.

**Example:**
- "Show DOT spending on street repairs by neighborhood, then show if street condition complaints decreased"

## The Technical Innovation

### Why This Is Different

**Traditional Approach:**
```
User → Single API → Single Dataset → Limited Answers
```

**Our Approach:**
```
User → Natural Language Query → Orchestrator
  ↓
Orchestrator analyzes intent
  ↓
Routes to multiple MCPs in parallel
  ↓
311 + HPD + DOT + Events + Comptroller
  ↓
Synthesizer finds correlations
  ↓
Actionable insights that span domains
```

### The Magic: Emergent Intelligence

When you combine:
- Where the city spends money (Comptroller)
- Where problems exist (311, HPD)
- Where infrastructure work happens (DOT)
- Where events impact daily life (Events)

You get insights like:
- Resource allocation effectiveness
- Correlation between spending and outcomes
- Neighborhood-level patterns
- Temporal cause-and-effect

## What Makes This Possible NOW

1. **MCP Architecture**: Composable, independent agents
2. **LLM Integration**: Natural language → structured queries
3. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple datasets queried simultaneously
4. **Smart Synthesis**: AI-powered correlation detection

## Scaling This Further

### Additional Datasets That Would Be Insane

**Crime Data (NYPD)**
- Correlate with street lighting, events, housing quality
- "Do well-lit areas with active community boards have less crime?"

**School Data (DOE)**
- "Relationship between school quality and neighborhood investment?"

**Health Data (DOHMH)**
- "Do housing violations correlate with health outcomes?"

**Environmental Data (DEP)**
- "Air quality vs traffic patterns vs asthma rates?"

### The Ultimate Vision

**A digital twin of NYC's operational systems** where you can ask:
- "What happens if we close this street for an event?"
- "Which neighborhoods need the most attention based on ALL city data?"
- "Is our spending effective based on outcome metrics?"

## Why This Matters

Cities generate MASSIVE amounts of data. But siloed data is just... data.

**Connected data becomes intelligence.**

This project proves you can build an intelligence layer that:
1. Works with existing APIs (no special access needed)
2. Answers questions that span domains
3. Scales to any city with open data
4. Gets smarter as you add more datasets

## Next Steps

1. **Prove the concept**: Run these 5 datasets and show the correlations
2. **Add LLM layer**: Use Claude/GPT to make synthesis even smarter
3. **Build UI**: Make this accessible to non-technical users
4. **Add more cities**: NYC → SF → Chicago → everywhere
5. **Sell it**: To journalists, city governments, research firms, real estate

**This is infrastructure for asking better questions about cities.**

That's the vision.
