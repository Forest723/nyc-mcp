EXCELLENT! You have all 5 data sources already implemented! Let me verify what's working:
Current Status:
LIVE & WORKING:
âœ… NYC 311 - 4 tools (complaints, response times, trends, neighborhood health)
BUILT BUT NOT YET WIRED UP:
ðŸ”§ NYC Comptroller - 3 tools (payroll, contracts, spending)
ðŸ”§ NYC DOT (Traffic) - 3 tools (parking violations, traffic volume, street closures)
ðŸ”§ NYC Events - 3 tools (search events, upcoming events, event impact analysis)
ðŸ”§ NYC HPD (Housing) - 4 tools (complaints, violations, registrations, housing health)
You have 17 total tools ready to go! We just need to wire them all into your main index.js file (which currently only has the 311 tools). Here's the plan to make everything talk to each other:
Import all the tool implementations from the other MCPs
Add their tool definitions to the TOOLS array
Add their case handlers in the switch statement
All 5 data sources will be accessible through your single nyc-open-data MCP server
This means you'll be able to:
Cross-reference noise complaints with nearby events
See if street closures correlate with complaint patterns
Check housing violations alongside 311 complaints for the same building
Analyze city spending patterns against service quality metrics
Want me to wire everything together? I won't touch any of your working 311 code - just add the other data sources!
